- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @m-murray52. My real name is Michael Murray. From Dublin, Ireland, I am currently in the first year of a PhD in Optical Holography at 
- Technological University Dublin (TUD). Prior to the PhD I completed an MSc in Medical Physics at National Universty of Ireland Galway (NUIG) - graduated 
- in 2021. It was during my time at NUIG that I commenced the PyDAP project as part of master's research. Essentially it is a computer vision tool written in 
- python for use in the measurement of dose area product (DAP) of X-ray beams; a proxy measure for absorbed x-ray energy.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in physics, Formula 1, judo, fitness, and languages (human and programming).
